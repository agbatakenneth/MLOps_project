## End-to-End Machine Learning Project: Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for Bank Customer Churn Prediction. The main Aim of this projectis to predict whether a person will leave the bank services i.e. if he or she will churn or not using ML techniques. The pipeline covers data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, deployment, monitoring, and CI/CD automation.
